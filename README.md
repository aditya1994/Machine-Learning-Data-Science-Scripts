# Machine Learning and Data Science Scritps

Scripts written using Python for analyzing datasets and implementing following ML algorithms:

1) Linear Regression
2) Neural Networks (from scratch) with Gradient Descent (and different optimization techniques)
3) CNN

For Machine Learning, Tensorflow and Keras are used for implementing different algorithms.
For Data Analysis, these python scripts uses libraries namely Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib to explore various datasets available.

Data set used: 

Sex-ratio.py : https://www.kaggle.com/bazuka/census2001
CNN.py: MNIST dataset preloaded in Keras / Tensorflow
gradientDescent.py: Fashion_MNIST dataset
